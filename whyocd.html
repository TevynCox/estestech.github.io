  <h1>
    Why OCD?
  </h1>

  <p>The reason we make OCD friendly websites is so that people with OCD are not<br>
   bothered by the "not correctly structured" layout of the websites.  So we try<br>
   to make it so that our websites are fun to read and look at.  If you believe<br>
   that something in here is not OCD friendly or something that does bother you<br>
   then you can file an issue in the estestech.github.io repository. <br>
   Also I tried to make this "why OCD" page OCD freindly as well.</p>
